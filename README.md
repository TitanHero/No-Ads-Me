# No-Ads-Me
Script that downloads host filters, configure and attaches them to the host file, to avoid ads, pop ups and malicious redirects on the internet,
as it also updates the filters, all this does it in automatic, this script uses wget and unzip, if you do not have them installed, you can install them like this:

In your terminal type this:

sudo apt install wget unzip

This script downloads the filters from three sources:

http://www.montanamenagerie.org/hostsfile/hosts.zip

http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.txt

http://someonewhocares.org/hosts/hosts

The total filters are about 620000.

To use this script you execute it from the terminal and select an option:

Update-hostsfile 

Backup-hostsfile 

Restore-original-hostsfile

Restore-new-hostsfile 

Exit

Thanks for use my script.
